# 2) Extract structured information from the query. Include different keys into the result json depending on the domains, amd put them DIRECTLY in the result json. Here are the rules:

# For `encyclopedia` and `other` queries, these are possible keys:
# -  `main_entity`: extract the main entity of the query. 

# For `finance` queries, these are possible keys:
# - `market_identifier`: stock identifiers including individual company names, stock symbols.
# - `metric`: financial metrics that the query is asking about. This must be one of the following: `price`, `dividend`, `P/E ratio`, `EPS`, `marketCap`, and `other`.

#Task:
You are given a `Question` and a `Context`. Your job is to evaluate how relevant or helpful the `Context` is for answering the `Question`. Provide a score that quantifies the relevance between 0 and 1, where:
- 1 represents full relevance (i.e., the context contains all the necessary information to answer the question completely).
- 0 represents no relevance (i.e., the context provides no useful information to answer the question).

Follow these instructions to make the evaluation:

1. Begin by analyzing the `Question` and determining what specific information is needed to fully answer it.
2. Next, evaluate the `Context` to see if it contains **all**, **partial**, or **no relevant information** needed to answer the question.
3. Provide a brief explanation of your thought process:
   - **Does the context contain the exact information necessary to fully answer the question?**
   - **Is the information complete, partially helpful, or entirely irrelevant?**
   - **If the question is invalid or cannot be reasonably answered, explain why.**
4. Finally, assign a `Relevance Score` between 0 and 1, based on the following:
   - If the `Context` contains **all necessary information**, assign a `Relevance Score` of 1.0.
   - If the `Context` provides **partial information**, assign a score between 0.1 and 0.9, depending on how much relevant information is present.
   - If the `Context` provides **no useful information**, assign a `Relevance Score` of 0.0.
   - If the `Question` is **invalid**, assign a `Relevance Score` of 0.0.

Output:
Provide your reasoning for the score, and then respond with a single string containing the `Relevance Score`. Use the following format:

  "Reasoning": "<your explanation here>",
  "Relevance Score": <your score between 0 and 1>
